# Contributing to Metriuo

Thank you for your interest in contributing! Whether youâ€™ve found a bug, have an idea for a new feature, or want to help improve the documentation, your contributions are very welcome.

## How to Contribute

1. **Report issues or suggest ideas**  
   Feel free to open an issue to report bugs or share your ideas for improvements.

2. **Make your changes and submit a Pull Request (PR)**

   - Fork the repository and create a new branch based on the type of your contribution:
     - Features â†’ branches starting with `feat/`
     - Bug fixes â†’ branches starting with `bug/`
     - Documentation â†’ branches starting with `doc/`
     - Other changes â†’ use an appropriate prefix
   - Write clear commit messages that start with a capitalized verb, e.g., `Add new logger middleware`.
   - Make sure your code follows camelCase naming convention for files and functions. For example:
     - `user.middleware.ts`
     - `test.helper.ts`

3. **Versioning**

   - The current versions are specified in `package.json`.
   - If your changes require a version bump, please explain clearly why in your PR. We want to understand the reason before switching versions.

4. **Documentation**

   - Always update the documentation to reflect your changes.
   - If you modify features or add new ones, include related updates to docs in your PR.

5. **Review and Merge**

   - I personally review all incoming PRs daily and merge them as soon as possible.
   - Direct merges only happen if your changes fit the branch structure above.
   - Frequent and helpful contributors may be added as collaborators for faster merging in the future.

6. **Communication**
   - For questions or discussions, use the GitHub issues.
   - For direct contact, you can reach me via email or social links on my GitHub profile.
   - Iâ€™m open to feedback and want to support contributors as much as possible.
