# Security Policy for Metriuo

Thank you for your attention to security. Keeping Metriuo safe and reliable is a shared responsibility.

## Reporting a Security Issue

- Please report any security vulnerabilities or concerns by opening an **issue** on this repository.
- Currently, there is **no dedicated security contact** or team â€” this is an open source project, and **we all share responsibility** to keep it secure.

## Response Time

- I personally review issues regularly, but response times may vary and could be slow unless active contributors help.
- Your patience and understanding are appreciated.

## Disclosure Policy

- Currently, Metriuo **does not send data to any external servers**; all logs are stored locally in your DuckDB instance.
- Therefore, there is no need for a strict disclosure policy yet.
- If in the future any external data collection or transmission is added, a proper security and disclosure policy will be implemented.

Thank you for helping!
